# Booth Junkie Video Processor Presets

Welcome to the Booth Junkie collection of custom **REAPER Video Processor presets**. These tools were crafted to help voice actors, editors, and content creators enhance their video workflows with animated waveforms, timers, motion text, audiograms, and more ‚Äî all within REAPER.

Many of these presets rely on **JSFX: video sample peeker**, which makes it possible to visualize audio data in real-time via shared memory. Others are standalone and require no additional setup.

## üîß Installation Instructions

To install these video processor presets in REAPER:

1. **Open REAPER**, then go to `Track FX` and add the **Video Processor** to a video track.

2. In the **Video Processor** window, click the **Preset dropdown** at the top and choose:
   - `Import preset...` to load individual `.txt` files.
   - Or use `Show REAPER resource path...` to open your REAPER resource folder.

3. For presets labeled **"Requires JSFX: video sample peeker"**:
   - Ensure that the **JS: video sample peeker** is added *before* the Video Processor in the FX chain.
   - You can find it by searching `video sample peeker` when adding an FX.

4. For some presets, adding another instance of Video Processor with the built in preset called `Combine: Chroma Key (RGB version) will let video tracks underneath this track show through green-screen style.

### Audiogram: Horizontal Bars
Displays a series of vertical bars that animate with audio amplitude, simulating a podcast-style audiogram. Uses shared memory from the JSFX "video sample peeker" to draw smoothed, gain-adjusted levels across the screen.

**Requires:** JSFX: video sample peeker (must be placed directly before this effect)

---

### Audiogram: Frequency Bars
Analyzes incoming audio with an FFT and displays real-time vertical bars representing frequency magnitudes across the spectrum. Features options for smoothing, logarithmic scaling, and bar spacing.

**Requires:** JSFX: video sample peeker (must be placed directly before this effect)

---

### Audiogram: Spectrum Analyzer
Creates a scrolling spectrogram along with a live frequency analyzer bar. FFT-based, with options for smoothing, hue customization, logarithmic frequency scaling, and mono mix input.

**Requires:** JSFX: video sample peeker (must be placed directly before this effect)

---

### Circular Waveform Visualizer (Animating Downward)
Displays a circular ring of waveform bars that radiate outward from the center, animating based on audio amplitude. Each bar represents a sample and moves based on waveform energy. The visual effect is dynamic and pulse-like.

**Requires:** JSFX: video sample peeker (must be placed directly before this effect)

---

### Countdown Effect
Displays a customizable countdown timer with hours, minutes, and seconds. Supports flashing on completion, positioning, and font control. Can optionally ignore input and just overlay on a blank background.

**Requires:** No JSFX required

---

### Smoothed Waveform with Angle
Draws a smoothed waveform along an arbitrary angle (e.g., diagonal or vertical). Supports polar modes, adjustable gain, smoothing, and full control over positioning and color.

**Requires:** JSFX: video sample peeker (must be placed directly before this effect)

---

 ### Smoothed Waveform with Orientation and Polar Options
Draws a linear audio waveform with support for both horizontal and vertical orientation. Includes multiple polar modes (bilateral, positive-only, negative-only, centered) and uses smoothing and gain control to refine the shape.

**Requires:** JSFX: video sample peeker

---

### Text Flicker or Pulse
Animates a block of text with rhythmic or randomized flicker/pulse effects. Supports opacity and scale-based animation modes. Useful for attention-grabbing countdowns, alerts, or stylized captions.

**Does not require JSFX**

---

### Text Jitter or Weave Effect
Applies motion animation to a text block using jitter (random) or weave (smooth sinusoidal) movement. Useful for creating a ‚Äúshaky‚Äù or stylized moving text. Includes adjustable frequency, direction, and amplitude.

**Does not require JSFX**

---

### Text Weave Effect
Simulates subtle projector-style shake using sine-based weave motion in vertical or XY directions. Designed for vintage or analog emulation. Timing is quantized for a stop-motion feel. Highly customizable amplitude, direction, and update rate.

**Does not require JSFX**

---

### Timer Overlay
Displays an on-screen timer starting from the item‚Äôs beginning. Configurable format includes optional hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds. Supports adjustable font, size, position, and background. Great for tutorials and voiceover timing.

**Does not require JSFX**
